First World Data Problems. This might someday be a collection of fun data cleaning and analysis problems, done in Python.

Some things so far (in the `/datahaus` directory):

- [San Diego historical crime tallies since 1950](datahaus/san-diego-police-historical-crime-actuals-1950-2014.pdf), found [here](www.sandiego.gov/police/services/statistics/index.shtml)
- [State of Kentucky election results for 2000 presidential race](datahaus/elect.ky.gov.2000results.statewidebycounty.txt), mentioned by [Derek Willis](https://twitter.com/derekwillis/status/595033438366859264)
- [List of Pan-Am Games athletes](datahaus/panamv3prod.pan-am-provisional_athletes.pdf), a problem mentioned on NICAR-L in terms of aggregating counts of athletes by country and gender and event.
